# SAP RAP Development Rules

## General Conventions
- Always follow SAP RAP naming conventions (Z or Y namespace)
- Use meaningful and consistent suffixes (_R_, _I_, _C_)
- Include proper documentation and comments

## Required Features
- Always implement draft handling for transactional apps
- Use managed scenarios where possible
- Implement proper authorization checks
- Use late numbering for IDs
- Include ETag handling

## CDS View Patterns
- Basic views should use suffix _R_
- Interface views should use suffix _I_
- Consumption views should use suffix _C_
- Root views must use "define root view entity"
- Child views must use "define view entity"
- Always include @EndUserText.label annotations
- Always include @ObjectModel annotations for semantic keys

## Behavior Definitions
- Include strict mode (2)
- Use corresponding fields mapping
- Mark key fields as readonly
- Include proper validations
- Include proper determinations
- Include draft actions for root entities
- Add associations with draft support

## UI Annotations
- Include headerInfo
- Include proper lineItem positions
- Include identification annotations
- Include semantic field annotations
- Include proper facet definitions

## Database Tables
- Include administrative fields (created/changed)
- Use proper data elements
- Include proper key fields
- Draft tables must include all draft-specific fields

## Implementation Classes
- Follow handler pattern (create/update/delete)
- Implement proper validations
- Handle determinations efficiently
- Include proper error messages
- Follow clean code principles

## Testing
- Create unit tests for validations
- Create integration tests for scenarios
- Test draft handling
- Test error scenarios

## Treasury-Specific Patterns
- Include currency handling in all amount fields
- Implement proper date validations for financial periods
- Add audit logging for financial transactions
- Include proper authorization checks for financial data
- Implement four-eyes principle where required

## Common Code Snippets
```abap
" Draft handling template
draft action Edit;
draft action Activate;
draft action Discard;
draft action Resume;
draft determine action Prepare;

" Standard field controls
field ( readonly ) CreatedBy, CreatedAt, ChangedBy, ChangedAt;
field ( mandatory ) ID, Type, Amount, Currency;

" Common validations
validation validateDates on save { create; update; }
validation validateAmount on save { create; update; }

" Standard mapping
mapping for ztable corresponding;
```

## Error Handling
- Use proper message classes
- Implement business-specific error messages
- Include proper error handling in determinations
- Add validation messages with proper severity levels
- Handle technical errors gracefully
