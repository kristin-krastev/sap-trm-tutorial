# Daily Learning Summary

## 1. SAP Architecture Understanding
- Clarified the relationship between different SAP technologies:
  - ABAP: Core business logic in S/4HANA
  - Fiori: Frontend framework for user interfaces
  - CAP (Cloud Application Programming): Framework for building cloud applications
  - Cloud SDK: Toolkit for SAP system connectivity

- Modern SAP Development Approach:
  ```
  Frontend Layer:        Fiori/UI5

  Extension Layer:      CAP/Node.js/Java
                           ↓
  Connectivity:         Cloud SDK
                           ↓
  Core System:          ABAP/RAP
  ```

## 2. Commodity Risk Management Components

### Distribution Characteristics
- Heavy-tailed distributions vs normal distributions
- Basic understanding of kurtosis and skewness
- Impact on risk calculations
- ABAP implementation considerations

### Physical Constraints
- Storage capacity management
- Transportation limitations
- Quality specifications
- Integration with risk calculations

### Volume-Price Correlation
- Real-time monitoring
- Risk adjustment factors
- Integration with physical constraints
- CDS view implementations

## 3. Practical Implementation

### Core Components
```abap
" Example structure
CLASS zcl_integrated_risk_calculator
  " Combines all three aspects:
  " - Distribution characteristics
  " - Physical constraints
  " - Volume-price correlation
```

### Testing Approach
