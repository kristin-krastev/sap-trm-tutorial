# Advanced Risk Management Concepts in SAP Treasury

## 1. Risk Aggregation Framework

### Overview
Risk aggregation is the process of combining different risk measures across various dimensions to provide a comprehensive view of risk exposure.

### Key Components

#### 1.1 Hierarchical Aggregation
- **Portfolio Level**: Individual position risks
- **Business Unit Level**: Combined portfolio risks
- **Legal Entity Level**: Consolidated business unit risks
- **Enterprise Level**: Total organizational risk exposure

#### 1.2 Risk Measure Aggregation
- **VaR Aggregation**
  - Simple summation (conservative approach)
  - Correlation-based aggregation
  - Copula methods for complex dependencies

- **Sensitivity Aggregation**
  - Linear measures (Delta) - Direct summation
  - Non-linear measures (Gamma, Vega) - Matrix-based approaches
  - Cross-risk factors consideration

#### 1.3 Time Horizons
- Intraday risk monitoring
- Daily risk aggregation
- Weekly/Monthly risk consolidation
- Quarterly/Annual risk reporting

### Challenges
1. **Data Consistency**
   - Different valuation times
   - Multiple data sources
