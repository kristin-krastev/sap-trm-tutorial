# Value at Risk (VaR) in SAP Treasury

## Overview
Value at Risk (VaR) is a statistical measure of potential loss in portfolio value over a defined time horizon at a given confidence level. It answers the question: "What is the maximum loss we can expect with X% confidence over Y time period?"

## Key Components

### 1. Parameters
- **Confidence Level**: Typically 95% or 99%
- **Time Horizon**: Usually 1-day or 10-day periods
- **Base Currency**: Currency for consolidated risk reporting
- **Historical Window**: Length of historical data used (typically 250-500 trading days)

### 2. Calculation Methods

#### 2.1 Historical Simulation
- Uses actual historical returns
- Non-parametric approach
- Steps:
  1. Collect historical price data
  2. Calculate daily returns
  3. Apply historical changes to current positions
  4. Sort results and find percentile

#### 2.2 Variance-Covariance (Parametric)
- Assumes normal distribution
- Uses volatility and correlations
- Steps:
  1. Calculate volatilities
  2. Build correlation matrix
  3. Apply to current positions
  4. Calculate portfolio VaR

#### 2.3 Monte Carlo Simulation
- Generates random scenarios
- Most computationally intensive
- Steps:
  1. Define distribution parameters
  2. Generate random scenarios
  3. Calculate portfolio values
  4. Analyze distribution of results
