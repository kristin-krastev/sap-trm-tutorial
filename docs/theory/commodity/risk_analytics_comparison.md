### Treasury Risk Management
- Focus on financial instruments (bonds, FX, interest rates)
- More stable volatility patterns
- Liquid markets with continuous pricing
- Normal distribution assumptions often valid
- Standard holding periods (10-day, 1-month)
- Clear market data sources

### Commodity Risk Management
- Physical delivery considerations
- Extreme volatility and seasonality
- Market illiquidity in some commodities
- Heavy-tailed distributions common
- Variable holding periods based on delivery
- Multiple price sources and basis risk

## 2. Stress Testing Specifics

- Seasonal peak scenarios
- Geopolitical supply disruptions

## 3. Risk Factor Sensitivity

### Treasury Risk Management
