# Commodity Price Risk Analysis

## 1. Understanding Commodity Price Risk

### 1.1 Definition
Price risk in commodities represents the potential for financial loss due to adverse movements in commodity prices. Unlike financial instruments, commodities have unique characteristics that affect their price behavior:
- Physical nature of the assets
- Storage and transportation costs
- Seasonal patterns
- Supply-demand fundamentals
- Weather impacts
- Geopolitical factors

### 1.2 Components of Price Risk

#### Absolute Price Risk
- Direct exposure to price movements
- Impact on procurement costs
- Effect on sales revenue
- Inventory valuation changes

#### Basis Risk
- Difference between hedged position and actual exposure
- Location basis (geographical price differences)
- Quality basis (grade or specification differences)
- Timing basis (calendar spread risk)

#### Spread Risk
- Inter-commodity spreads
- Calendar spreads
- Location spreads
- Quality spreads
