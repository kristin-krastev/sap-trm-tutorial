# Commodity Risk Analytics: Key Adaptations from TRM

## 1. Value at Risk (VaR) Adaptations

### Heavy-Tailed Distribution Handling
- **Why Different from TRM**: Commodity price changes often exhibit:
  - Extreme price movements
  - Higher kurtosis
  - Significant skewness

- **Required Modifications**:
  - Use of Student's t-distribution instead of normal distribution
  - Implementation of Extreme Value Theory (EVT)
  - Cornish-Fisher expansion for better tail estimation
  - Historical simulation with longer lookback periods

### Physical Delivery Constraints
- **Additional Considerations**:
  - Delivery location impact on price
  - Transportation costs and constraints
  - Storage capacity limitations
  - Quality/grade adjustments

- **Implementation**:
  - Adjust VaR calculation horizon based on delivery schedules
  - Include transportation cost volatility
  - Factor in storage cost uncertainty
  - Add quality premium/discount volatility

### Seasonality Adjustments
- **Key Differences**:
  - Seasonal price patterns
  - Seasonal volume patterns
  - Weather-related volatility changes

- **Implementation Methods**:
  - Seasonal volatility adjustments
  - Rolling window calibration
  - Season-specific scenarios
  - Weather factor incorporation

## 2. Expected Shortfall (ES) Modifications

### Volume-Price Correlation
- **Additional Risk Factors**:
  - Volume uncertainty
  - Price-volume correlation
  - Delivery timing uncertainty

- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Joint distribution modeling
  - Copula-based dependence structures
  - Conditional ES calculation
  - Volume-weighted ES metrics

### Physical Position Impact
- **Considerations**:
  - Storage capacity constraints
  - Transportation limitations
  - Quality/grade variations

- **Adaptations**:
  - Position-adjusted ES
  - Location-specific ES
  - Quality-adjusted ES calculations

## 3. Stress Testing Enhancements

### Supply Chain Scenarios
- **Additional Scenarios**:
  - Transportation disruptions
  - Storage facility outages
  - Quality degradation events
  - Weather-related disruptions

- **Implementation**:
  - Multi-factor stress scenarios
  - Supply chain bottleneck analysis
  - Capacity constraint testing
  - Weather impact modeling

### Combined Stress Testing
- **Integration Points**:
  - Price stress + Volume stress
  - Weather events + Transportation
  - Quality issues + Price impact
  - Storage constraints + Market conditions

## 4. Risk Metrics Integration

### Volume-Adjusted Metrics
- **New Metrics**:
  - Volume at Risk (VaR)
  - Delivery at Risk (DaR)
  - Storage Utilization Risk
  - Transportation Risk

- **Implementation**:
  - Combined price-volume metrics
  - Capacity utilization metrics
  - Delivery reliability metrics

### Location-Based Analysis
- **Considerations**:
  - Basis risk between locations
  - Transportation constraints
  - Regional market conditions

- **Implementation**:
  - Location-specific risk metrics
  - Basis risk calculations
  - Transportation route analysis

## 5. Performance Measurement

### Risk-Adjusted Returns
- **Additional Factors**:
  - Physical delivery costs
  - Storage costs
  - Quality maintenance costs
  - Transportation expenses

- **Modified Metrics**:
  - Physical-adjusted Sharpe ratio
  - Delivery-adjusted returns
  - Quality-adjusted performance

### Benchmark Adaptations
- **Considerations**:
  - Location-specific benchmarks
  - Quality-adjusted indices
  - Seasonal patterns
  - Physical delivery costs

## 6. Implementation Challenges

### Data Requirements
- **Additional Data Needs**:
  - Physical position data
  - Quality/grade information
  - Transportation costs
  - Storage capacity data
  - Weather data

### Model Calibration
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Seasonal pattern calibration
  - Volume-price correlation estimation
  - Physical constraint modeling
  - Weather factor incorporation

### System Integration
- **Integration Points**:
  - Physical trading systems
  - Quality management systems
  - Transportation systems
  - Weather data feeds

## 7. Best Practices
