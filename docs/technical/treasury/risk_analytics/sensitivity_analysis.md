# Risk Factor Sensitivity Analysis Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of risk factor sensitivity analysis in SAP Treasury. The implementation calculates key sensitivity measures (Delta, Gamma, Vega) for various financial instruments and risk factors.

## Core Components

### 1. Sensitivity Calculator Class

The `zcl_trm_sensitivity_calc` class provides the main implementation for sensitivity calculations:

```abap
CLASS zcl_trm_sensitivity_calc DEFINITION
  PUBLIC
  CREATE PUBLIC.

  PUBLIC SECTION.
    METHODS:
      calculate_sensitivities
        IMPORTING
          it_positions     TYPE ztrm_tt_positions
          it_market_data  TYPE ztrm_tt_market_data
        RETURNING
          VALUE(rt_sensitivities) TYPE tt_risk_factors.
```

### 2. Risk Measures

#### Delta
- First-order sensitivity to changes in the underlying risk factor
- Calculated using finite differences with appropriate shift sizes
- Different shift sizes for different risk factors (e.g., 1 pip for FX, 1bp for rates)

#### Gamma
- Second-order sensitivity (rate of change of delta)
- Important for non-linear instruments like options
- Calculated using three-point approximation

#### Vega
- Sensitivity to volatility changes
- Only relevant for options and volatility-dependent instruments
- Calculated using 1% volatility shift

## Implementation Details

### 1. Risk Factor Shifts

Standard shifts by risk factor type:
- FX Rates: 0.0001 (1 pip)
- Interest Rates: 0.0001 (1 basis point)
- Equity/Commodity Prices: 0.01 (1%)

```abap
METHOD get_risk_factor_shift.
  CASE iv_factor_type.
    WHEN 'FX_RATE'.
      rv_shift = '0.0001'.
    WHEN 'INTEREST_RATE'.
      rv_shift = '0.0001'.
    WHEN 'EQUITY_PRICE'.
      rv_shift = '0.01'.
  ENDCASE.
ENDMETHOD.
```

### 2. Position Valuation

The implementation supports different instrument types:
- Spot positions
- Forward contracts
- Options (using Black-Scholes model)
- Interest rate swaps

### 3. Market Data Handling

Market data shifts are applied differently based on risk factor type:
- Multiplicative shifts for prices (FX, equity, commodity)
- Additive shifts for rates
- Volatility shifts for options

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Caching

- Position valuations are cached where possible
- Market data shifts are minimized
- Intermediate calculations are reused

### 2. Parallel Processing

For large portfolios:
- Positions can be processed in parallel
- Results are aggregated after calculation
- Memory management is optimized

## Testing Framework

### 1. Test Coverage

The test class `ltcl_sensitivity_calc` covers:
- FX forward delta calculation
- Interest rate swap delta
- Equity option gamma
- Option vega calculation
- Multiple risk factor scenarios

### 2. Test Data

Standard test scenarios include:
- FX Forward (EUR/USD)
- Interest Rate Swap
- Equity Option

```abap
" Test position setup
mt_positions = VALUE #(
  ( position_id     = '1'
    instrument_type = 'FORWARD'
    risk_type      = 'FX_RATE'
    nominal_amount = 1000000 )

  ( position_id     = '2'
    instrument_type = 'SWAP'
    risk_type      = 'INTEREST_RATE'
    nominal_amount = 5000000 ) ).
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Risk Analytics Framework

The sensitivity calculator integrates with:
- VaR calculation
- Expected Shortfall
- Stress testing framework

### 2. Market Data

Connects to:
- Real-time market data feeds
- Historical data storage
- Volatility surface calculations

## Best Practices

1. **Numerical Stability**
   - Use appropriate shift sizes
   - Handle small numbers carefully
   - Validate results against bounds

2. **Performance**
   - Cache intermediate results
   - Use parallel processing for large portfolios
   - Optimize market data access

3. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive unit tests
   - Integration tests with market data
   - Benchmark against known results

## Error Handling

1. **Input Validation**
   - Check position data completeness
   - Validate market data availability
   - Verify parameter ranges

2. **Calculation Errors**
   - Handle division by zero
   - Check for overflow/underflow
   - Log numerical instabilities

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Calculation time per position
   - Market data access time
   - Memory usage

2. **Quality Checks**
   - Sensitivity bounds validation
   - Market data freshness
   - Calculation convergence

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Features**
   - Cross-gamma calculations
   - Theta (time decay)
   - Rho (interest rate sensitivity)

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - GPU acceleration for large portfolios
   - Distributed processing
   - Advanced caching strategies
